# Data Wrangling Project on NYC Motor Vehicle Collision Data

I started this project with the intent to practice my data wrangling skills with SQL and refine my EDA skills working with a dataset that is not so clean. This project is based on a [dataset]([url](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95/about_data)) provided by NYC Open Data regarding Motor Vehicle Crashes in NYC. Provided was a single csv file with over 2 million records acquired on 06/09/24. This project involved multiple steps to clean, analyze, and derive insights from the data. I have attached a SQL file with my queries and annotations for the purposes of each and my findings.
