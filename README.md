# Data Wrangling Project on NYC Motor Vehicle Collision Data

I started this project with the intent to practice my data wrangling skills with SQL and refine my EDA skills working with a dataset that is not so clean. This project is based on a [dataset](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95/about_data) provided by NYC Open Data regarding Motor Vehicle Crashes in NYC. Provided was a single csv file with over 2 million records acquired on 06/09/24. This project involved multiple steps to clean, analyze, and derive insights from the data. I have attached a SQL file with my queries and annotations for the purposes of each and my findings. Queries can be found [here](https://github.com/mystic0608/nyc_motor_vehicle_collisions/blob/main/Queries_1.sql).

# Key Findings
* Brooklyn has the highest number of collisions, while Staten Island has the lowest.
* Driver distractions are the top contributing factor leading to injuries and deaths.
* Collisions peak during rush hours and are highest on Fridays.
* Fall has the highest number of collisions, while Winter has the lowest.
* Atlantic Avenue in Brooklyn has the highest collision rate by street.
* Bronx has a higher injury and fatality rate per collision compared to other boroughs.

# Recommendations
* Implement stricter enforcement against driver distractions and create awareness campaigns especially during the fall season. 
* Increase traffic management during rush hour
* Notify the state to see if any infrastructure improvements can be made on high collision streets like Atlantic Avenue and any other hot spots.
* Ensure accurate data collection for future analysis.
